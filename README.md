Django Docker Boilerplate - Django Rest Framework with Redis, RabbitMQ and Celery
===============================================================================

# Notice
- This boilerplate is no longer supported. Thank you very much for the contribution and it's now only supported the second version [Here](https://github.com/tiagoarasilva/django2-boilerplate)

## Note

- The template is using foundation as a framework but this can be changed by your personal preference, you only need to update the references in the `static` and `templates` folder.
- Inside the views located in accounts, there are some that you need to create your own files, such as the registration or change password, the code is there, you only need to place the HTML inside the proper directory. The only HTML placed and working is the login and the homepage to allow you to do a first run.
- Comes with a bunch of plugins for many kinds of projects. Not all of them are needed, feel free to remove what you don't need
- This boilerplate is now supporting [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
- Read more about this [here](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

# Installing from the template base

- `django-admin startproject --template=https://github.com/tiagoarasilva/django-boilerplate/archive/master.zip --extension=py,md,html,txt,scss,sass project_name`
- Make sure you change the "project_name" to the name you desire for you project.
- The tests for the views won't work until you implement the solution to make the tests passing, that means, once you implement the views!

# Docker

- Change the {{ project_name }} in your docker file to the desired name gave to the project when running the previous command.

# {{ project_name }} Docker

-  Run `docker volume create --name={{ project_name }}_db_data`
-  Run `docker-compose up`. It will download all the resources needed to build your docker containers
-  Run `docker-compose exec {{ project_name }} bash` to go inside the container
-  Run `make run` to start the server (inside docker container)
-  Run `make shell` to start the shell_plus

If you desire, you can create somes aliases in your local machine, inside the bash_profile/bashrc/profile to do automatically some previous instructions for you

E.g.:

```shell
alias shell_plus='docker-compose exec {{ project_name }} bash && make run'
alias run_server='docker-compose exec {{ project_name }} bash && make shell'
```

# First run with the project

- Inside docker container:
    - Run `make migrate`. This is a special command inside the Makefile to run the first migration or if you are on windows or you don't want to run the Makefile, just run `python {{ project_name }}/manage.py migrate`
    - Run `python {{ project_name }}/manage.py createsuperuser` to create a super user for yourself
    - It will create a "User Admin" by default as first and last name respectively. This can be changed in `accounts/management/commands/createsuperuser.py`


# Run Tests (If you ran migrations before and need to reconstruct the DB schema)

`make unittests TESTONLY='profiles.tests.models_tests'`
- OR
`make unittests TESTONLY='profiles.tests.models_tests:ProfileUserTest.test_create_user'` for a specific test

# If you only need to run the tests and the models weren't changed before

`make reusedb_unittests TESTONLY='profiles.tests.models_tests`

### Apps

All of your Django "apps" go in this {{ project_name}} directory. These have models, views, forms, urls, 
templates or all of the above. These should be Python packages you would add to
your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
